HIGH PRIORITY INTERNATIONAL SOURCES
Implementing the top 5 untapped sources:
1. Germany (BWB) - Europe's largest defence market
2. Japan (ATLA) - Major technology partner
3. Israel Defence - Cyber security and tech leadership
4. European Defence Fund - €7.9B research funding
5. Major US Primes - Subcontracting opportunities

Maintaining SME focus with appropriate value ranges and defence relevance.
