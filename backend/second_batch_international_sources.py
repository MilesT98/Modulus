SECOND BATCH INTERNATIONAL SOURCES
Implementing the next tier of high-value untapped sources:
1. France (DGA) - Major defence technology leader
2. South Korea (DAPA) - Electronics and advanced manufacturing  
3. Sweden (FMV) - Advanced technology and materials
4. Norway - NATO ally with Arctic focus
5. Additional EU Programs (PESCO, NATO Innovation Fund)

Maintaining SME focus with appropriate value ranges and defence relevance.
