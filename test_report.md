# Modulus Defence Platform Testing Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the testing results for the Modulus Defence platform, focusing on the newly implemented tiered access model and related features. Testing was conducted on both the backend API and frontend UI to verify that the business requirements are being met.

## Testing Methodology

1. **Backend API Testing**:
   - Created and executed automated tests for all API endpoints
   - Tested both free tier and pro tier user journeys
   - Verified access control for tier-specific features
   - Tested data retrieval and filtering capabilities

2. **Frontend UI Testing**:
   - Used Playwright for automated UI testing
   - Tested user registration and login flows
   - Verified tier-specific UI elements and restrictions
   - Tested upgrade functionality
   - Verified access to premium features

## Test Results

### Backend API Testing

#### Free Tier User Testing:
- ✅ Registration works correctly
- ✅ User is correctly assigned to free tier
- ✅ Free tier users are correctly prevented from accessing live data refresh (403 error)
- ✅ Dashboard stats are correctly displayed for free tier users
- ⚠️ No delayed Pro opportunities were found in the test data

#### Pro Tier User Testing:
- ✅ Registration and upgrade to Pro tier works correctly
- ✅ User is correctly assigned to Pro tier after upgrade
- ✅ Pro users can access opportunities without delay
- ✅ Advanced filtering works for Pro users
- ✅ Pro users can access data sources information
- ✅ Pro users can create opportunities
- ❌ Live data refresh fails with a 503 error because the data integration service is not available (expected behavior as per code comments)

### Frontend UI Testing

#### Free Tier User Testing:
- ✅ Registration works correctly
- ✅ User is correctly assigned to free tier
- ✅ Advanced filters are correctly locked for free users
- ✅ Upgrade modal appears when clicking on Procurement Act Hub
- ⚠️ No delayed Pro opportunities were found in the test data

#### Pro Tier User Testing:
- ✅ Upgrade to Pro tier works correctly
- ✅ User is correctly assigned to Pro tier after upgrade
- ✅ Pro users can access Procurement Act Hub
- ✅ Live data refresh button is available and clickable for Pro users
- ✅ Data sources information is displayed for Pro users
- ❌ Advanced filters are not properly displayed for Pro users after upgrade

## Issues Identified

1. **Live Data Integration**:
   - The live data refresh functionality returns a 503 error because the data integration service is not available
   - This is expected behavior as mentioned in the code comments, but should be addressed for production

2. **Advanced Filters for Pro Users**:
   - After upgrading to Pro tier, the advanced filters are not properly displayed in the UI
   - This appears to be a frontend issue where the UI is not correctly updating after the tier change

3. **Delayed Opportunities for Free Users**:
   - No delayed Pro opportunities were found for free users during testing
   - This might be due to test data not having the right conditions or an implementation issue

## Business Requirements Verification

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Free tier sees delayed opportunities with proper badges | ⚠️ Partially Verified | Backend logic is in place, but no delayed opportunities were found in test data |
| Pro tier sees real-time opportunities immediately | ✅ Verified | Pro users can see all opportunities without delay |
| Advanced search restricted to Pro/Enterprise users only | ✅ Verified | Free users see locked filters with upgrade prompts |
| Procurement Act Hub completely locked for free users | ✅ Verified | Free users see upgrade modal when attempting to access |
| Upgrade prompts working correctly throughout the platform | ✅ Verified | Upgrade prompts appear when free users attempt to access premium features |

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Advanced Filters for Pro Users**:
   - Investigate why advanced filters are not properly displayed after upgrading to Pro tier
   - Ensure the UI correctly updates after tier changes

2. **Implement Data Integration Service**:
   - Complete the implementation of the data integration service for live data refresh
   - Add proper error handling for when the service is unavailable

3. **Add More Test Data**:
   - Add more test data with varied conditions to better test the delayed opportunities feature
   - Ensure there are opportunities with different tier requirements and creation dates

4. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add more descriptive error messages for users when features are unavailable
   - Implement graceful degradation for when backend services are unavailable

## Conclusion

The Modulus Defence platform's tiered access model is mostly working as expected. Free tier users are correctly restricted from premium features, and Pro tier users can access premium content. The upgrade functionality works correctly, allowing users to seamlessly transition between tiers.

The main issues identified are with the advanced filters not being properly displayed for Pro users after upgrade and the expected unavailability of the data integration service. These issues should be addressed before the platform is released to production.

Overall, the platform meets most of the business requirements for the tiered access model, with a few minor issues that need to be resolved.
